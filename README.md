# 🏡 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project implements a **Linear Regression model** to predict house prices based on given features such as area, number of bedrooms, and other housing attributes. The goal is to build a **simple yet effective regression model** to understand the relationship between housing features and price, and make accurate predictions.

## 🚀 Features  
- Preprocessing of housing dataset (handling missing values, feature scaling, etc.)  
- Implementation of **Linear Regression** using `scikit-learn`  
- Model training and evaluation with **R² Score** and **RMSE**  
- Visualization of predicted vs actual prices  
- Easy-to-understand workflow for beginners in **Machine Learning**

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset contains housing attributes such as:  
- 📏 Area (square feet)  
- 🛏 Bedrooms  
- 🛁 Bathrooms  
- 🏙 Location  
- 💰 Price (Target Variable)
